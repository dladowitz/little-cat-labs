I wanted to work on one of the really big problems in america today.
Something so big it either affects you or someone you know.
So what did I do? Well I built an internet connected scale to weigh things.
What things? Well cats specifically.

Wait cats? Yeah cats.
And I know it sounds funny at first.
But here me out. I haven't taken societies body image issues and extended it to cats or anything that crazy.

About five months ago I took my cat to the vet for growth on it's chin.
The vet said, don't worry about that, it's cat acne. But you're cat is overweight.
It needs to go on a diet now.

Ok, so I started reading up on how to help my cat, Aiko, loose weight.
And according to a bunch of research it turns out 50% of cats are overweight.
And guess how many cats there are in america? 100 million. So that 50 million overweight cats.
I started talking to vets, and vet techs and managers at pet supply stores.
All of them agreed that most cats are overwieght and it's a health issue that degrades quality of life in older years.
Cats get arthritis, joint issues, diabetes, and even heart problems.
Probably the most noticable is some cats stop jumping up and down because it hurts their joints.
